   - Implement roles like student, instructor, and administrator.

2. **Course Management:**
   - Instructors can create courses with details such as title, description, and content.
   - Include options for adding text, images, videos, and quizzes to course modules.

3. **Enrollment and Progress Tracking:**
   - Students should be able to enroll in courses.
   - Track and display course progress, completed modules, and overall completion percentage.

4. **Interactive Quizzes and Assignments:**
   - Include a feature for instructors to create quizzes with multiple-choice questions.
   - Allow students to submit assignments and receive feedback.

5. **Discussion Forum:**
   - Implement a discussion forum where students and instructors can interact.
   - Include features like threaded discussions, post replies, and upvoting.

6. **Notifications:**
   - Implement a notification system to alert users about new course content, discussions, or assignment feedback.

7. **Search and Filter:**
   - Enable users to search for courses based on categories, keywords, or instructor names.
   - Implement filters for sorting and refining search results.

8. **Responsive Design:**
   - Ensure the application is responsive, providing a seamless experience across devices.

9. **User Dashboard:**
   - Create personalized dashboards for users to view enrolled courses, completed courses, and upcoming assignments.

10. **Admin Panel:**
    - Develop an admin panel to manage users, courses, and monitor overall system activity.
    - Include features for analytics and reporting.

11. **Payment Integration (Optional):**
    - If you want to add an extra layer of complexity, integrate a payment system for premium courses.

## Technologies

### Backend
- Express.js for building the server.
- MongoDB or PostgreSQL for database management.
- Passport.js for authentication.

### Frontend
- Use a frontend framework like React or Vue.js for a dynamic user interface.
- Bootstrap or another CSS framework for styling.

### Additional Tools
- Socket.io for real-time communication in the discussion forum.
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication.
- Testing frameworks like Mocha and Chai for testing.

## Challenges

1. **Real-Time Updates:**
   - Implement real-time updates for discussions and course progress using Socket.io.

2. **Security:**
   - Ensure secure authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect user data.

3. **Scalability:**
   - Design the system with scalability in mind, considering a potential increase in users and courses.

4. **Testing:**
   - Write comprehensive tests to ensure the reliability and functionality of your application.

5. **User Experience:**
